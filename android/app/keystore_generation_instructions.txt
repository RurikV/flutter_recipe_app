# Keystore Generation Instructions

To generate a keystore for signing your app, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the android/app directory of your Flutter project.

2. Run the following command to generate a keystore file:
```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

3. You will be prompted to:
   - Enter a password for the keystore
   - Enter your name, organization, city, state, and country
   - Confirm the information is correct
   - Enter a password for the key (you can use the same password as the keystore)

4. Keep the keystore file (upload-keystore.jks) secure and remember the passwords.

5. Create a key.properties file in the android directory with the following content:
```
storePassword=<password from step 3>
keyPassword=<password from step 3>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=../app/upload-keystore.jks
```

Note: For this example, we're using a debug keystore for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should generate a proper keystore and keep it secure.
